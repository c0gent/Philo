### Materialism and The Matrix: What can a silly (but entertaining) movie tell us about the fundamental nature of reality? And why the hell is this movie still such a damn useful reference when discussing metaphysics?

When Neo swallowed the red pill, the pill he was told would wake him from his dream and disconnect him from the Matrix, he began a journey into a strange new universe ... reality. This new world was almost identical to his usual, virtual, world. Neo still had to eat, drink, sleep, and (presumably) poop. Now though, his world was 'real' and not 'virtual.' So what's the difference? What makes reality any different than imagined worlds or universes?

According to polls ([1][2]) referenced in a 2015 Scientific American article ([3]) over 71% of Americans believe in miracles. Roughly 74% currently believe in God ([4]). Exactly how to define, gods and miracles is (and likely never will be) definitely established, however it they are both, by definition, supernatural phenomena. They have causal origins outside of the natural world.

There is an illuminating connection between Neo's Matrix and *any* supernatural reality proported to exist. One supersedes the other. The Matrix is a 'layer' of reality. That matrix universe exists within ('on top of') an abstracted and hierarchically superior reality (one level above, a branch to a leaf of a tree):

* Neo's Universe (the 'real world')
  * The Matrix (where you can dodge bullets if you're cool enough)

 So, the 'universe' inside The Matrix is a simulation running on machines (computers) of the next level up the heirarchy. It is a virtual world runs on top of the layer underneath just like an online game. 

The supernatural realm is exactly the same thing. The natural universe, according to supernaturalists, is a layer of reality which is superceded by the supernatural universe. Nature must in this case be a simulation running (executing/existing) directly 'on top of' the supernatural realm *or* must be running on another shared substrate (just like a program running on a computer or a task/objective running within your mind).

So if any realm outside of nature exists, the metaverse (reality) would be shaped like either...

* Supernatural Realm
  * Natural Realm

Or...

* Some Lower-level Substrate (this substrate, being outside of nature, would incedentally also be supernatural)
  * Supernatural Realm
  * Natural Realm

And you can create all kinds of permutations all day long but the metaverse is actually constructed like this:

* Natural Realm

That's it.

We don't even need to be concerned with the fact that space and time is a blur which we can think of as many universes (hence the multiverse... actually the fundamental nature of the reality we experience is just one crystallized snapshot of the 'blur' of spacetime, constantly splitting and merging). But that doesn't matter, we must first define the bounds of nature and reality before one can crack into those details. Reality is reality. Existence exists. The natural realm must, by definition, encompass all of reality, all universes, all metaverses, everything we can ever know about or have any glimpse whatsoever. 

As has been argued many, many times, If there is a supernatural realm and it has any influence whatsoever on the natural world it must, necessarily, be a part of the natural world. For a single particle, force, or signal of any kind to transfer from one realm to the next by definition makes those two realms one and the same. If there is an 'underworld' where thoughts and minds exist *and* that underworld has any impact of any kind on the 'surface' world, it is by definition, a part of it. It would not therefore be of any use at all to describe it as separate in the same way that we don't describe the world of the Andromeda galaxy any differently than we do our Milky Way.

Any argument that about a realm that we cannot understand or cannot explain falls apart pretty quickly. It is akin to saying that our natural realm somehow cannot produce a computer which can form any explanation at all about the realm encompassing it. If that is true, if the 'rules' of the supernatural realm are eternally mysterious, yet our realm is a supposedly a subset of it (just as the Matrix is a subset of Neo's universe), then why should be bother trying to understand anything at all? If our natural world is somehow constructed in such a way that we will never be able to see the hands of the puppeteer holding the strings or the hidden quantum strings, then there is no sense at all in even discussing or thinking abuot it.

I do not believe that is the universe we live in.

I don't want to spend too much time on a topic that has been well explored by a ton of brilliant authors (i.e. [5] [6], [7], [8]) and one or two other philosophers, etc. ([9]) but I would sum up our present understanding of the structure of the metaverse as follows: 

* To define a realm of reality outside of and 'above' nature, a realm that supposedly cannot be comprehended, represented, or simulated via the mechanisms we have available to us here in the natural realm, and that yet somehow dictates, controls, or has any causal connection to it, is logically ridiculous (I'd say Hume [10] and Popper [11] are two good examples of the many authors who construct the basis for this argument, Popper is especially brilliant in almost every aspect of his thinking).

* If this supernatural realm is amenable to our powers of reasoning, it is not supernatural and is simply part of nature.

This must be the foundation of any discussion about what's going on in this crazy universe.
