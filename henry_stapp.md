## [Henry Stapp](http://www.informationphilosopher.com/solutions/scientists/stapp/) Part 1/2

Before I get into the article I want to make one thing clear. While I do believe that we live in a deterministic world, I do not believe that this determination has any bearing on how we should make decisions in our lives or changes anything whatsoever about how we should think about things. All I claim is that absolutely *any* universe which is coherent, is by definition deterministic.

You might think, "But wait! Quantum processes are non-deterministic! We can't predict the outcome of a measurement of a quantum system." And you would be partly right. *We* can't predict the result of a quantum observation but that does not mean it isn't pre-determined. A quantum state, though hidden from us up until we measure (and alter) it, can just as easily be pre-determined as your choice of breakfasts.

Also note that the entire discussion about the quantum world also includes the fact that our reality (the multiverse) splits, blurs, merges, and actually does many things at the same time even when we perceive only one. But none of this behavior at all means that it isn't a deterministic process, indeed you soon find that it only makes sense at all if determinism underlies it all...

We poor humans just have a hard time thinking about all that and it makes the problem seem more mysterious than it really is but I digress...


### Free Will

Re-quoting Stapp:

>It might seem that a mere capacity to pose questions and register answers would leave our mental egos just as helpless and impotent as before. But the quantum mechanical process of posing questions and receiving responses is not like the classical mechanical process, in which our observations have no physical effects. In QM, the observer’s free choice of which question to ask plays a critical role in determining which potential material property will become actualized.

>In QM, the observer asks Nature a yes/no question about the state of a system...Normally, this dependence of the properties of the system being probed, upon the observer’s choice of question does not give the observer any effective control over the observed system. That is because Nature’s response can be “No”.

>However, there is an important situation in which, according to the quantum rules, the “No” answers will be strongly suppressed. In that case, the free choices made by the observer can exert effective control over the system being probed – which, in von Neumann’s theory, is the brain of the observer.

>Suppression of the “No” responses is predicted if an initial “Yes” response is followed by a sufficiently rapid sequence of posings of the same question. In that case the observer becomes empowered, by his own free choices, to hold stably in place a chosen brain activity that normally would quickly fade away. This effect is the celebrated “Quantum Zeno Effect”


Note that you can replace the term "free choice" with "pre-determined choice" and these statements are as true:

> ... the observer’s pre-determined choice of which question to ask plays a critical role in determining ...

> ... the pre-determined choices made by the observer can exert effective control over the system being probed ...

> ... In that case the observer becomes empowered, by his own pre-determined choices, to hold stably in place a chosen brain activity that normally would quickly fade away. ...

You might think that his use of the word 'empowered' somehow is incongruent with this sentiment but the bulb in my flashlight, empowered by a battery, would argue otherwise.

On a side note, these statements are a prime example of a bad explanation. If pieces of them can be changed willy-nilly and they are no less true or false, there's some extraneous stuff in there (see religion).


### Non-locality

This comes up all the time and is basically key to the quantum-mind argument.

Stapp:

> the combined system of two far-apart particles acts as a single global entity, in the sense that it is not possible to impose the following causality requirement: "What a scientist decides to do to one part of a system cannot affect in any way how the system will respond at the same instant to a measurement performed upon it far away." Thus a quantum system seems able to behave as a unified entity: What you do to it in one place can influence how it will react to a simultaneous probing far away.

> The profoundness and irrevocability of this collapse of the classical local-reductionistic conception of the physical universe was not fully recognized even by Einstein, Podolsky, and Rosen: it became clear only after John Bell had prepared the way with his famous "Bell's theorem". The basic message of Penrose's book, as of mine, is that the enormous changes that have been wrought by quantum theory in our ideas about the fundamental nature of matter have altered radically the problem of the connection of mind to matter.

Ok how?

Article Author: 

> Stapp knows that the two-particle quantum state is a single system that can extend over huge distances, and that information "somehow" must be "transferred" over those distances instantaneously. He also knows the two experimenters are spacelike separated, so no causal influence is possible, in either direction. Information is neither matter nor energy, and information about probabilities is instantly present everywhere without any "transfer."

Sure but what does that have to do with the mind? Not much.


### Creativity

Article Author: 

> Stapp identifies Mind with the process of creation. Everything that exists is created by this process. In particular, every "reduction" or "collapse" of the wave function adds a bit of information to human knowledge. Stapp's process consists of a well-ordered sequence of creative acts called events. He says that any event is prior to all those that follow it in this sequence, and is subsequent to all those that come before it in this sequence. This sounds like the causal sequence of classical determinism. Following Whitehead's book Process and Reality, he describes each creative act as a grasping, or prehension, of all that has been created by prior acts in a novel but unified way.
Stapp endorses novelty and creativity. He says, "Each creative act brings into existence something fundamentally new: it creates a novel "emergent" quality."

Stapp (apparently from a video):

> A wave function that represents the brain is all smeared out. All these quantum mechanical possibilities are there on an equal footing. If I'm going to say something, for example, there are a lot of possibilities for what I might say. The way quantum mechanics works there is this mysterious thing called the collapse (or reduction) of the wave function. What happens is, this big smear of possibilities - or potentialities - suddenly get reduced. This reduction is associated with an increase of knowledge.

Ummm, sorry. Creativity is largely an emergent property of the random spiking activity of layer 5 cells (**trial**) and the error-correcting mechanisms of pain and reward (**error**). This is as true for athletic creativity as it is for linguistic creativity. This is completely describable by the well understood biochemical and electrical processes within and between cells. No magic quantum spice required I'm afraid.


### The Brain

Stapp:

> The brain is viewed in this theory as a self-programming computer, with the aforementioned mutually exclusive self-sustaining neural patterns acting as the carriers of the top-level codes...

Uhhh, no. The brain is programmed by a combination of genes and the creative process of interacting with the environment. That's it.

> ... Each such code exercises top-level control over lower-level processing centers, which control in turn the bodily functions, and, moreover, construct the new top-level code. This new code is constructed by brain processes acting in accordance with the causal quantum-theoretic laws on localized personal data: the new code is formed by integrating, in accordance with directives from the current top-level code, the information coming from external stimuli with blocks of coding taken from codes previously stored in memory. This causal process of construction necessarily produces, by virtue of the character of the quantum-theoretic laws, not just one single new code, but a superposition of many, each with its own quantum-mechanical weight. The conscious act has as its image in the physical world, as represented by contemporary physical theory, the selection of one of these superposed codes.

Yeah... not how the signals in the brain are processed. Sorry.


### Information

> The basic theme of both Copenhagen and post-Copenhagen quantum theory is that the physical world must be understood in terms of information: the "tiny bits of matter" that classical physics had assumed the world to be built out of are replaced by spread-out nonmaterial structures that combine to form a new kind of physical reality. It consists of an objective carrier of a growing collection of "nonlocalized bits of information" that are dynamically related to experiential-type realities...

> ... The new conception essentially fulfills the age-old philosophical idea that nature should be made out of a kind of stuff that combines in an integrated and natural way certain mind-like and matter-like qualities, without being reduced either to classically conceived mind or classically conceived matter. This new quantum structure entails the validity of all the scientifically validated empirical data, while at the same time explaining how our thoughts can influence our actions in a way concordant with our normal experience of that connection...

> ... Still, I believe that there will be near-unanimous agreement among quantum physicists that, to the extent that a rationally coherent conception of physical reality is possible, this reality will be informational in character, not material. For the whole language of the quantum physicist, when he is dealing with the meaning of his symbols, is in terms of information, which an agent may or may not choose to acquire, and in terms of Yes-or-No answers that constitute bits of information. Just getting that one idea across could make a significant inroad into the corruptive materialist outlook that, more than three-quarters of a century after its official demise as a basic truth about nature, still infects so many minds.

Nope. Sorry. You've got this all terribly confused, Mr. Stapp. Matter is just one possible instantiation of information. Information can be encoded within matter but it can also be encoded in energy. There is no 'Information-y' reality below our the material one, the two are inescapably intertwined.

Interesting way of looking at things though, in a kaleidoscope-dreamy kind of way (was I supposed to be high when I read it?). 


### Mind-Brain Quantum Evolution

> This process is a local dynamical process, with all the causal connections arising solely from interactions between neighboring localized microscopic elements.

Ummm, ok.

> Each of these quantum events involves two other processes. The first is a choice of a Yes-No question by the mind-brain system. The second of these two processes is a choice by Nature of an answer, either Yes or No, to that question...

Got it.

> This second choice is partially free: it is a random choice, subject to the statistical rules of quantum theory

Ok.

> ... The first choice is the analog in von Neumann theory of an essential process in Copenhagen quantum theory, namely the free choice made by the experimenter as to which aspect of nature is going to be probe.

Ummm, hang on a sec. First of all I'm a computer scientist and I've never heard of von Neumann's "theory of an essential process" but I'll assume he's referring to the von Neumann architecture (the design of basically every modern digital processor). I'm wracking my brain to figure out what the analog of that architecture in Copenhagen quantum theory would even mean. Hmmm let's read on...

> This choice of which aspect of nature is going to be probed, i.e., of which specific question is going to be put to nature, is an essential element of quantum theory: the quantum statistical rules cannot be applied until, and unless, some specific question is first selected.

> In Copenhagen quantum theory this choice is made by an experimenter, and this experimenter lies outside the system governed by the quantum rules. This feature of Copenhagen quantum theory is not altered in the transition to von Neumann quantum theory: the choice of which question will be put to nature, is not controlled by any rules that are known or understood within contempory physics. This choice associated a mind-brain-body system is, in this specific sense, a free choice: it is not governed by the physical laws of contemporary physics (i.e., quantum theory). This freedom constitutes a logical “gap” in the dynamical rules of contemporary physical theory.

Yeah don't make the mistake of thinking that the 'experimenter' in quantum theory need be a conscious entity. It could be a stray electron or an atom of a falling meteorite, whacking into particles on its way towards the surface of a planet. 

Just because the experimenter may lie ouside of the small system you are observing, **in no way** means it is outside of the system governed by quantum rules. Obviously the experimenter doesn't magically vanish from the universe just because it's convenient for us when reasoning about quantum theory not to worry about the details of it. The experimenter is there, it's just that it's details *can* be considered an irrelevant variable if that simplifies things for you!

This kind of reasoning just hurts to read. I now feel dumber.

> A key micro-property of the human brain pertains to the migration of calcium ions from the micro-channels through which these ions enter the interior of nerve terminals to the sites where they trigger the release the contents of a vesicle of neuro-transmitter. 

I have no idea why he specifically focuses on calcium ions moving across the pre-synaptic membrane via ion channels (micro-channels does sound cooler) as that is just one part of the somewhat more complex workings of a synaptic junction. If I were him I would have chosen electrical propigation of the action potential from the post-synaptic membrane down the dendrite as a place to interject quantum-voodoo but to each their own.

> The quantum mechanical rules entail that each release of the contents of a vesicle of neurotransmitter generates a quantum splitting of the brain into different classically describable components, or branches. 

I haven't read that quantum mechanical rule (ahem) but the last time I checked the release of the contents of a vessicle of neurotransmitter simply spills neurotransmitter into the synaptic cleft, continuing the propagation of the signal to the next (post-synaptic) cell. This is a ridiculously well understood process and is taught in every basic neuroscience classroom.

I must have missed the section about the generation of a quantum splitting of the brain (was I supposed to be high when I read it?).

> Evolutionary considerations entail that the brain must keep the brain-body functioning in a coordinated way and, more specifically, must plan and effectuate, in any normally encountered situation, a single coherent course of action that meets the needs of that individual. But due to the quantum splitting mentioned above, the quantum brain will tend to decompose into components that specify alternative possible courses of action. Thus the purely mechanical evolution of the state of the brain in accordance with the Schroedinger equation will normally causes the brain to evolve into a growing ensemble of alternative branches, each of which is essentially an entire classically described brain that specifies a possible plan of action.
